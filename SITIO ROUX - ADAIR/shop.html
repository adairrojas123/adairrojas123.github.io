					<p><h2>About the event</h2>

						The Roux Academy’s annual conference and exhibit is designed to foster a close-knit relationship amongst artists at various universities around the world. But sign up early, as this not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting list is long. In addition, art students are encouraged to send in works from their school portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, as well as to be selected as a Featured Artist
					</p>
					<h1>Barot Bellingham</h1>
					<img src="images/Barot_bellingham_tn.jpg"><br>

					<h1>Jonathan G. Ferrar Ll</h1>
					<img src="images/Jonathan_Ferrar_tn.jpg"><br>
					Labeled as “The Artist to Watch in 2016” by the London Review, Johnathan has already sold one of the highest priced commissions paid to an art student, ever on record. The piece, entitled Gratitude Resort, a work in oil and mixed media, was sold for $750,000.</p>
					<h1>Hillary Hewitt Goldwynn-Post</h1>
					<img src="images/Hillary_Goldwynn_tn.jpg"><br>

					<img src="images/Hassum_Harrod_tn.jpg">
					<p>
					The Art College in New Dehli has sponsored Hassum for his entire undergraduate career at the university, seeing great promise in his contemporary paintings of landscapes - that use equal parts muted and vibrant tones. Hassum will be speaking on “The use and absence of color in modern art”.</h1>
					
					<h1>Elizabeth Hall</h1>
					<img src="images/LaVonne_LaRue_tn.jpg">
					<p>Labeled as “The Artist to Watch in 2016” by the London Review, Johnathan has already sold one of the highest priced commissions paid to an art student, ever on record. The piece, entitled Gratitude Resort, a work in oil and mixed media, was sold for $750,000 </p>

					<h1>Victoria Hall</h1>
					<img src="images/Constance_Smith_tn.jpg">
					<p>Drawing and painting flowers may seem like a first-year art student’s assignment, but Constance Smith brings depth, shadows, light, and color to new heights with his unique technique of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze. This session is sure to be a hit with mixed media buffs. </p>
					<h1>Jennifer Jerome</h1>
					<img src="images/Jennifer_jerome_tn.jpg">
					<p>Jennifer Jerome, a native of New Orleans, whose work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, will talk about how the floods inspired her artistically, and how, despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost, her work also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has persevered. </p>
					<h1>Riley Rewington</h1>
					<img src="images/Riley_Rewington_tn.jpg">
					<p>Grab your pencils, charcoal, acrylics, watercolors, or whatever painting tools suit your fancy, and participate in the capturing of various still life settings that are staged all around Dennison Hall. You won’t believe the wealth and depth of choices </p>
					<h1>Xhou Ta</h1>
					<img src="images/Xhou_Ta_tn.jpg">
					<p>Get on your mittens and earmuffs, and join your fellow artists at the Fountain of Intrigue, in the Hotel Contempo gardens, where the ambient temperature has been turned down to allow the sculpting of ice into the most mysterious and beautiful of shapes. Richard Reed will share his secrets for chiseling ice into a shape that your imagination has envisioned. There is an extra fee of $25 for the rental of the tools needed to sculpt ice, if you plan to participate. And we hope you do!</p>
